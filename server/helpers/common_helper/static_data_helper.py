Lemming is a visualization tool for the selection of plans for a given
problem, allowing the user to efficiently whittle down the set of plans
and select their plan(s) of choice.
We propose three different user experiences for this process,
all based on the principle that using landmarks as guidance
can help cut down the set of choice points for the user.
